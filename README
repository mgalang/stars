Stars - A simple star reward web app

What's this?
============

I needed a reward system for my kid that allows me to give him a star everytime he deserves it,
and if he completes it he gets a reward. This app does just that. 
I built it with SpineJS, Bootstrap, Mustache, and HTML5 goodness. 
Data are store using HTML5 local storage.
